* Identified inventory management, product pricing, store management structure, and customer segmentation


# [Project 3: Python Calculators](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ISOM352-Projects-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Calculators.py)
* Develop Mortgage Payment Calculator & Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calorie Calculator in Python 
* Implemented loops to differentiate mortgage payment rates and metabolic rates 


# [Project 4: Midterm](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Identify RDBMS concepts and manipulate data with MySQL and Python
* Suggest solutions to business problems from insights gained from manipulated data


# [Project 5: Webscraping & Sentiments](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Webscraping of online reviews for movies by writing a Pythin function that takes the parameter url and returning a list of reviews
* Write a Python loop function to get the sentiment score for each review in a list
* Create final three lists that contains all of the sentiment scores for each movie and rank from most positive rating to most negative rating


# [Project 6: Citibike Cutomer Segmentation](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Query data by using Python pandas to get average trip duration and number of trips for customer segments such as gender, age, day of the week, gender and age, and gender and day of the weel 
* Plot scatterplots for single variable sements (gender, age) from manipulated data by using Python seaborn 
* Control buble size in order to represent insights such as average trip duration and number of trips for multi variable segments 


# [Project 7: Gapminder Visualization](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Create visualizations such as bar chart, line chart, pie chart, choropleth, and scatter plot by using Python plotly 


# [Project 8: Linear Regression for NBA Players](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Explore data and develop a hypothesis on what player-game attributes are most likely to cause higher average points/games-played (PTS/GP)
* Check for correlation between independent variables and create heatmap of the matrix by using Python plotly
* Run linear regression model and analyze significant coefficients and unexpected outcomes


# [Project 9: Anomaly detection In Influenza like Illness data](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Utilize Python isolation forest to identif weeks when anomalies are first detected over the years using specfic columns from the group by function


# [Project 10: Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Gather a year worth of data from coca cola, x, and y's stock data and 5 similar stocks by using _________.
* Create two columns for closing price movement direction for the focal stock and the percentage change in opening price
* Create final data frame from manipulating data above
* Predict movement of the focal stock by using percentage change in opening price of all 5 stocks by using the MLP model


# [Project 11: Customer Reviews and Sentiment](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Gather Starbucks, Khaldis, and Dunkin Donut's review data from Yelp API library and run a sentiment analysis for each business
* Group Starbucks and competitors in order to create 2 different wordclouds that shows positive and negative reviews


# [Project 12: Analysis of Disney Movies](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/Analysis-of-Disney-Movies)
* Integrated MySQL through Python and debugged string errors with RegEx operators and analyzing the schema’s relationship through joins and group by functions
* Visualized relationships between 5 datasets though matplotlib and seaborn to guide Disney film’s future marketing strategies
* Advise marketing strategies for upcoming Disney movies by running a linear regression model that resulted a 99% accuracy and create a film review word cloud through NLP (Natural Language Processing) model
